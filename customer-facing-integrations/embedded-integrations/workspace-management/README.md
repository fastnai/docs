# Workspace Management

## Getting Started with Workspaces in Fastn

* Multiple users can collaborate on a single workspace with role-based access assigned by the workspace **Admin**.
* When you first log in to [**Fastn**](https://live.fastn.ai/app), a workspace titled "My Workspace" is created by default. After selecting your workspace, you'll be directed to the next page to set up your integrations.

&#x20;If you have more than one workspace, you will be provided with an option to choose your respective.
{% endhint %}

## Workspace Settings[​](https://docs.fastn.ai/docs/workspace-management#workspace-settings)

* Create or delete API keys with desired permissions to use when calling flows externally.

* Manage secrets that can be utilized across different flows.

* Collaborate with others by inviting them to your managed workspaces. With RBAC (role based access control) give users in your workspace the desired permissions.

* Manage deployment environments. Multiple versions of created flows can be deployed across different environments.

* With different environments, different configurations can be assigned and used in flows through variables.

* Models created as input and output schema for different flows can also be managed in the workspace settings.

## Managing Tenants in Fastn

Fastn supports **multi-tenant architecture**, making it easy to build and manage flows for different clients, teams, or environments — all within a single workspace.

### What is a Tenant?

A **tenant** represents an isolated environment for a particular user within your workspace. It helps separate data, configurations, credentials, and workflows for different customers, business units, or systems. Fastn's built-in multi-tenancy ensures complete **data isolation and secure execution** for each tenant.

### How to Manage Tenants

You can manage all your tenants from the **Tenants** section in the left sidebar.

#### Creating a Tenant

1. Click the **"Create Tenant"** button in the top right.
2. Enter a unique name for your tenant.
3. Once created, the tenant will appear in the list with options to **edit** or **delete**.

#### Creating a Tenant Secret

1. Click on an existing tenant in the list.
2. Select **'Create Secret'** to add credentials like API keys or tokens.
3. These secrets are securely scoped to the tenant, ensuring access is restricted to flows running within that tenant's context.
