# Trigger

It helps you start automated actions based on real-time activities such as new messages, form submissions, or updates in integrated systems.

* You can add this component by searching for **Trigger** in your flow. Once added, you’ll first need to **select an app** from the available list or search for the required one.&#x20;

* After selecting the app, connect and authenticate your account to enable access.

* After saving, the Trigger will automatically listen for the selected event.

{% hint style="info" %}
Based on the selected app, a list of **Trigger events** will appear.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

> &#x20;In the case of Slack, when a message is posted in the specified channel, the trigger will activate and send a message from Fastn to that channel.

* Next, select the **account ID** associated with the connection, for example, _Fastn_.&#x20;
* In the **Headers** section, add the required key–value pairs for authentication or configuration. Once you’ve entered all details, click **Save** to finalize this step.

* You can choose the event that should start your flow. For example, when integrating with Slack, you can select the **Message Posted** trigger event.

* You can test this step by clicking the **Test** button in the top right corner.&#x20;

> The console will display the result, and you’ll see the message sent to your selected Slack channel.
