## Building your AI Agent On Chat Request

* Select the starting point for your flow. For example, if you want to build your AI agent in **Fastn** through chat message, select **On Chat message**, name your flow, and click on **Build** to start.

* Click on the **"+"** symbol within your Flow canvas.
* In the component search bar, type **“AI Agent”** and select it.
* In the AI model section, select an AI model of your choice.
* Next, from the **model dropdown**, choose the AI model best suited for your use case (e.g., **Gemini 2.0**).
* Under the **Prompt** section, define the input the agent should use, for example:\
  `{{input.chatInput}}`
* Adjust your **Session ID**, **Memory Table Name,** and **Memory Content Limit** as required.
* Click **Save** to confirm your configuration.

* You will now need to get into the loop of your connected AI Agent to select your apps to connect and set up necessary actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Inside each connected tool, you can add or delete individual parameters and map them to input values that are static or defined automatically by the model, as shown below. You can learn more about data mapping from [data-mapping-in-flows.md](data-mapping-in-flows.md "mention")

## AI Action

AI Action is your tool in Fastn to trigger action in your connected apps based on a single prompt without any model selection or complex flows.

### Building your AI Action on API Request

* Select the starting point for your flow. For example, if you want to trigger any task in **Fastn** through an API request for seamless system integration, select **On API Request**, name your flow, and click on **Build** to start.

{% hint style="info" %}

* You can now write a simple prompt with the message you want to send with the Channel Name e.g,

```
"Send a message test to Slack Channel ai_testing"
```

* Click **Save** and test run your flow by clicking **Test** from the top-right corner.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can deploy the flow to any of your selected environments to go LIVE.
{% endhint %}
