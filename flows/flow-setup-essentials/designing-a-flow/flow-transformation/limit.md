# Limit

The **Limit** feature is available under **Flow Transformation**.

You can place it immediately after any connector step, such as **Zendesk**, **Salesforce**, **HubSpot**, or others, to control how many items from a returned list should move to the next step.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is especially useful when you only want to process a subset of records instead of the full list.
{% endhint %}

### **Use Case Example**

Suppose you are building a flow where you fetch a Zendesk ticket and want to notify only a limited number of collaborators about an update. Zendesk’s **Get Ticket** action returns a list of `collaborator_ids`, but you may only want to process the first 5 collaborators.

This is where **Limit** helps.\
You can narrow the list, e.g., to the first 5 collaborator IDs, before sending them to further steps such as **email**, **Slack**, or additional logic.

### **How does the Limit feature work?**

* After your connector step (for example, **Zendesk → Get Ticket**), add the **Limit** step from the **Transformation Actions** section.

* In the **List** field, provide the list you want to limit.\
  For example, if you're retrieving ticket details from Zendesk, you can use:\
  `{{steps.getTicket.output.ticket.collaborator_ids}}`

* In **Max Items**, enter the maximum number of items you want to allow through.\
  **Example:** `5`

*   Choose the **starting direction** for the limit:

    * **From First Item**
    * **From Last Item**

    This defines whether the limit applies from the beginning or end of the list.
