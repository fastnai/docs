  In this guide, you'll create a Google Doc with some content and automatically
  share it to a Slack channel. We'll use Fastn to connect the two apps and make
  the workflow run in just a few steps.

# Create a Google Doc and share it to Slack - using UCL

### Google Docs

* You need to authenticate your Google account, after which the Google Docs App will appear as **Connected**.
* From Select Tools, you can enable the **Create Doc** Action.

### Slack

* Similarly, you need to connect the Slack App and enable the **Send Message** Action.

* You will now be able to see the selected apps with enabled actions on your dashboard.

### Test in Playground

* You can use the **Playground** (from the three-dot menu, top right) in your dashboard to test all your connected apps.

### Creating a Google Doc and Sending it to Slack

* In the AI Assistant, enter the prompt describing the action you want to perform. For example:

> _Create a Google Doc titled "MCP Server"_

Next, you can give a command to add content to the document or send it to a Slack channel right away.

> _Send the doc to slack channel \*channel\_name\*_

> For every command prompt, the assistant would ask you to confirm execution by clicking on the **Run Tool** button.

Once successful, you will see a success message in the assistant, and the document will be sent to the potential Slack channel.

> This setup allows you to automate and streamline document creation and sharing it across different platforms using natural language, making workflows faster and more efficient.
