# Connect UCL for task Assignment in Jira

{% hint style="info" %}
UCL's Playground is the overview of how your AI agent will work with integrated Connectors and Actions (Tools) through UCL.
{% endhint %}

### Connect your Jira account to UCL

For this use case, we need to connect the Jira App with the Assign Issue Action.

> You can select any app by checking the top-right box on the app and click on **Select Tools** to modify your action selection and then finalize this setup by clicking the **Confirm Action** button in the right-bottom.

* You need to authenticate your Jira account, after which the Jira App will appear as **Connected**.
* From Select Tools, you can enable the **Assign Issue** Action.

> ⚠️ You may need to be a Jira project admin or have the right permissions to link your account successfully.

You will now see Jira along with other selected apps in your dashboard.

### **Use UCL’s Playground to Perform Actions**

You can use the **Playground** (from the three-dot menu, top-right) in your dashboard to test all your connected apps.

In the AI Assistant, enter the prompt describing the action you want to perform. For example:

> _Assign "Task Name" to "User's Jira ID"_

The AI Assistant will process your request using the appropriate action in the connected app, such as updating a task in Jira.

Once successful, the task ownership will be updated in your Jira workspace.
