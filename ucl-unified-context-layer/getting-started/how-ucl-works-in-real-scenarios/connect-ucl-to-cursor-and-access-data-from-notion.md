### **Connect Cursor to UCL**

* Download and install the latest version of [Cursor](https://cursor.com) on your desktop.
* Open Cursor and navigate to **Settings** in the top-right corner.
* Next, in the **MCP** section, click **Add Custom MCP**; this opens a file named `mcp.json`.

You can select and follow the guide for any client of your choice from the embed page to integrate it with UCL.

* &#x20;In the **Open Setting and Add MCP Server** step, you will see the Cursor command code, which you can copy for your workspace and paste it into Cursor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Checking the **Multi Tenant** option will enable you to embed connectors and actions for multiple users \[users].
{% endhint %}

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fastn": {
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "url": "https://mcp.ucl.dev/shttp/space_id={}&tenant_id=test-tenant&auth_token=customAuthToken"
    }
  }
}

```

* Paste this configuration into the `mcp.json` file in Cursor and **save** it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you’ve selected an **agent;** it's not auto-set.
{% endhint %}

*   In the assistant, it will ask for your Notion database ID after you have given a command like:

    ```
    Fetch summary from Notion for the meeting titled "Meeting Name"
    ```
* The assistant will use the **"Get Tasks"** or a relevant action to retrieve notes.
* The meeting summary should appear directly in your AI plane, ready for review or further processing.
