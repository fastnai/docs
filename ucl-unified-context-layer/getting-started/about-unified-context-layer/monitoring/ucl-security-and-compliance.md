# UCL Security & Compliance

Unified Context Layer (UCL) is built with enterprise security, compliance readiness, and operational resilience at its core. The platform provides isolation, observability, and governance across multi-tenant environments while ensuring that every agent, connector, and data transaction is protected.

## 1. Access Control & Permissions

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Granular roles and permissions ensure that every user, tenant, and connector only has access to what they need.
* Supports fine-grained access at connector, dataset, and action levels, enabling organizations to enforce least-privilege policies across large teams.
* Allows for the separation of duties between developers, administrators, and end-users.

### Scoped Tokens

* AI agents operate using short-lived, scoped tokens that restrict access by role, time, or data type.
* Tokens automatically expire, reducing the risk of credential leakage.
* Designed to support enterprise rotation policies and integration with SSO / identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Ping.

### Context-Aware Controls

* Access rules adapt dynamically based on role, time-of-day, geolocation, or tenant policy.
* Example: restricting sensitive data actions (e.g., exports) outside of working hours.

### Isolation by Design

* Each tenant's connectors, flows, and agents run in fully isolated execution sandboxes, preventing cross-tenant data leakage.
* Supports both logical isolation (per-tenant namespaces) and infrastructure isolation (dedicated environments).

## 2. Real-Time Monitoring & Logging

### Comprehensive Audit Trails

* Every agent request, connector call, variable update, and data transfer is logged.
* Full traceability ensures end-to-end accountability for compliance and forensics.

### Real-Time Dashboards

* Security and operations teams can monitor live agent sessions, execution health, error rates, and data movement across tenants.
* Dashboards highlight anomalies, failed authentications, and API throttling in real time.

### Immutable Logs

* All logs are stored with cryptographic integrity (hash chaining) to prevent tampering.
* Supports WORM (write once, read many) storage for regulatory environments.

### Event Attribution

* Each log entry is tied back to a tenant, user, connector, and AI agent identity.
* Enables granular forensics in case of a breach or compliance audit.

## 3. Compliance-Ready Architecture

### GDPR & SOC 2 Alignment

* UCL is designed with data minimization, right-to-erasure, and security controls aligned to GDPR principles.
* SOC 2 readiness ensures enterprise-grade operational, security, and availability controls.

### HIPAA-Ready

* Supports healthcare-grade encryption, auditability, and access control for HIPAA-covered integrations.
* PHI data is always processed in compliance with least-privilege principles.

### Data Residency Controls

* Execution environments can be pinned to specific regions (EU, US, APAC).
* Ensures data sovereignty for organizations operating under local data residency laws.

### Retention Policies

* Configurable data retention lifecycles for logs, agent memory, and connector transactions.
* Supports audit requirements with customizable retention periods (in days, months, or years).

## 4. Threat Detection & Prevention

### Anomaly Detection

* Machine learning models identify unusual usage patterns, such as unexpected data requests or excessive traffic.
* Alerts are automatically surfaced in security dashboards.

### Prompt Injection Protection

* Built-in defenses detect malicious prompt injection attempts, blocking agents from escalating privileges or exfiltrating data.
* Policy-driven filtering ensures AI remains bound within compliance rules.

### Data Exfiltration Prevention

* Monitors outbound data flows for bulk export attempts or unauthorized destinations.
* Can enforce hard throttles and notify admins in real time.

### Privilege Escalation Detection

* Detects when an AI agent or user attempts to bypass assigned RBAC policies.
* Automatic alerts and session termination safeguard tenant boundaries.

## 5. Enterprise-Grade Deployment

### Zero-Trust Principles

* All connections require continuous identity and authorization validation.
* No implicit trust, every request must be authenticated and authorized at runtime.

### Encryption Everywhere

* TLS 1.2+ enforced for data in transit.
* AES-256 is used for data at rest.
* Support for HSM-backed encryption keys and customer-managed keys (CMK).

### Flexible Deployment

* Available as cloud SaaS, private cloud, on-premises, or hybrid.
* Meets regulated or air-gapped enterprise needs (e.g., finance, government).

### SIEM Integration

* Audit logs can be streamed directly into Splunk, Datadog, Elastic, or custom SIEM platforms.
* Enables centralization of alerts in enterprise SOC workflows.

## 6. Business Continuity & Governance

### High Availability

* Redundant architecture ensures failover and clustering across zones.
* No single point of failure for critical agent and connector operations.

### Disaster Recovery

* Automated backups and restore processes for connectors, policies, and audit logs.
* RTO/RPO targets are configurable for enterprise SLAs.

### Policy Versioning

* Every security or compliance policy is version-controlled and auditable.
* Allows rollbacks during misconfiguration or during audits.

### Governance Dashboards

* C-suite, compliance, and IT leaders gain real-time visibility into agent behavior, policy enforcement, and data compliance status.
* Customizable dashboards for CISO, compliance officer, and operations teams.

## Why AI Builders, Teams, and Enterprises choose UCL?

* **Purpose-Built:** Designed for AI agents and MCP connections, not retrofitted legacy systems.
* **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Guarantees no cross-tenant leakage.
* **Compliance-Focused Foundation:** Reduces audit prep and regulatory risks.
* **End-to-End Observability:** Every action is traceable, explainable, and governable.
